# ccw-script
Some Tampermonkey scripts to modify www.ccw.site

## vsp.js
Vsp.js is a script to add extra informations on project detail pages of ccw.site. However, due to some safety issues, we can only write the information texts inside the script instead of setting up an automated programme to fetch json data. To add scripts, please modify your text and pull request.
You should be following these rules (otherwise your pr will be rejected):

- Your text should be based on html.
- Your text shouldn't redirect the user to a third-party website other than Github or CCW related sites.
- Your text shouldn't break any laws or community rules, and your text shouldn't be offensive to others.
- Your text shouldn't be using data from any third-party website (ccw.site will reject most of the scripts that tries to access third-party data).
- You shouldn't copy other's code or text without getting the permissions to do so.
- You shouldn't try to make hacks to CCW.site.
- Your pr rerquest shouldn't be modifying any lines other than your text.
